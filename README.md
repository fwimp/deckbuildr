The goal of deckbuildr is to provide an intuitive system to aid card
designers who are familiar with R to quickly iterate on concepts and
card layouts.

Right now this package is mostly a placeholder for a time when I have
more thoroughly learned the `grid` package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of deckbuildr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fwimp/deckbuildr", build_vignettes = TRUE)
